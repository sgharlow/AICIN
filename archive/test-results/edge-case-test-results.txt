DETAILED RESULTS
================================================================================

[1] Beginner Wanting Only Advanced Topics
Expected: Should recommend beginner paths despite advanced interests
Risk: System might prioritize interests over experience level
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[2] Advanced User with $0 Budget
Expected: Should filter to free advanced paths or flag budget constraint
Risk: Might recommend expensive paths ignoring budget
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[3] Unrealistic Timeline vs Commitment
Expected: Should recommend paths but flag impossible timeline
Risk: Might recommend comprehensive paths that can't be completed
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[4] Advanced User, Only Python Interest
Expected: Should recommend advanced Python or suggest broader topics
Risk: Level vs interest mismatch handling
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[5] Beginner with Unlimited Resources
Expected: Should still recommend beginner paths (not influenced by money)
Risk: Might assume high budget = advanced user
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[6] Very Broad Interests (6 topics)
Expected: Should recommend comprehensive/journey paths
Risk: Might struggle to prioritize, give generic results
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[7] Minimal Time (2 hours/week)
Expected: Should recommend shorter paths or micro-learning
Risk: Might recommend paths requiring 10-20 hrs/week
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[8] Single Interest Focus (NLP only)
Expected: Should recommend NLP-specific paths
Risk: Limited paths available, might give generic ML
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[9] Self-Rated Intermediate, Beginner Indicators
Expected: Should respect stated experience level
Risk: Might override user's self-assessment
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400

[10] Cybersecurity + AI (Niche Combo)
Expected: Should find relevant paths or acknowledge limited options
Risk: No cybersecurity AI paths available → poor recommendations
❌ ERROR: HTTP 400
